        Although I have not attended formal training programs related to my field of study, I have dedicated myself to self-learning through online resources, hands-on projects, and collaboration with peers. This approach has enabled me to develop a strong understanding of the core principles of my course and apply them in real-world scenarios. I am committed to continuously improving my skills and am always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge.
